## #1 ls

The ls (list) command is used to list directories or files. By default (i.e. running ls with no options at all) the command will return the directories and files of the current directory, excluding any hidden files. Some of the most useful options are:

    ls -a: List all the files in the current directory including hidden files too
    ls -l: Long listing of all the files and their size in the current directory
